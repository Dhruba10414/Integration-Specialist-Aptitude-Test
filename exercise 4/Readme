In this exercise, I have created the sequence diagram with draw.io (app.diagrams.net). According to my thinking, I had three objects: Welcome, JIRA and JIRA server. I take request from the marketer in welcome software and send a API request to JIRA and JIRA server will give me the response. 

I checked the conditions, if all of them are okay then JIRA board will create the card and give me the issue id as response. 

With this issue id, whenever any change comes to welcome, I will create another request to store the change in the Jira server.
