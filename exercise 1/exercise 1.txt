## Requirement 1:
	1. Hit GET /v3/upload-url to get s3 presigned upload url, from the response {key} will needed further.
	2. Hit Post /v3/assests with payload {key, title}, from the response {id} will needed further as asset_id.
	3. The asset should also attached to a task for getting custom-fields, labels and add a comment.
	   there is a endpoint /tasks/{id}/assets where id is the task_id but can't figure out to create a new task api.
	   May be it can be assumed to already have a task_id.
	4. Hit the legApprove api endpoint with {key} to send the asset for validation

## Requirement 2
	Hit GET /tasks/{id} with the task id and from the response[labels][1][values], labels can be pushed to legApprove

## Requirement 3
	Hit GET /tasks/{id}/custom-fields and extract custom fields from response[values] ==> list and push back in legApprove

## Requirement 4
	Can't figure out how to update External Work Information
	May be adding a sub_step for a task make the solution but again i did not figure out an api to create sub_step of a task

## Requirement 5
	Didn't find any due_date data on any api endpoint of Welcome. So may be this is not supported.

## Requirement 6
	Hit POST /tasks/{task_id}/assets/{asset_id}/comments with task_id=id, asset_id=asset_id with payload {value: comment, attachmets: NULL} to notify asset is being reviewed.

## Requirement 7
	Hit POST /tasks/{task_id}/assets/{asset_id}/drafts with payload {key: key from uploader from step 1, title}

## Requirement 8
	Can't figure out any appropiate api endpoint.


I was confused with tasks and library part, both are pretty smilar, may be there are some better ways.
